# What will be the output of the following code?



# x = 10
# y = 20
# print(x == y)
# Evaluate the expression:



# x = 15
# print(x > 10 and x < 20)
# Identify the correct operator to use for "less than or equal to."

# What is the result of:



# a = 5
# b = 5
# print(a != b)
# Write a  condition to check if a variable z is both greater than 10 and less than or equal to 50.

# Logical Operators
# What will this expression evaluate to?



# x = 3
# print(x < 5 or x > 10)
# Predict the output of the following code:



# x = 7
# y = 12
# print(not(x > y or y < 15))


# Which logical operator would you use to ensure two conditions are both true?  

# What does the not operator do when applied to a boolean expression?

# Simplify this statement using logical operators:
# x = 8
# if (x > 10 and x < 20):
#     print("Valid")



# Identity Operators
# Determine the output:



# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [1, 2, 3]
# print(a is b)


# What will x is not y return if x and y refer to different objects with the same value?
# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [1, 2, 3]

# print(a is  b )

# Is it possible for x == y to return True but x is y to return False? Explain with an example.
# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [1, 2, 3]
# print(a  ==  b )
# print(a is  b )

# Write a condition to check if two variables a and b point to the same object in memory.

# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = a

# Membership Operators   in ,not in 
# Predict the output:
# text = "Hello, World!"
# print("Hello" in text)
# fruits = ["apple","banana","apple",1,2,3,4,"True",True]
# print(fruits)

# Question 1: Basic For Loop
# fruits = ["apple", "orange", "grape"]
# Write a for loop to print each fruit in the list.

# Question 2: Looping with Index Numbers
# Write a program that uses the range() function to loop through the list below and prints the index and the corresponding item.
# animals = ["cat", "dog", "rabbit"]

# Question 3: While Loop
# Use a while loop to print each element in the list until the end.
# colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]

# Question 4: List Comprehension
# Rewrite the following code using list comprehension:

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# for num in numbers:
#     print(num)

# Question 5: Custom Message in Loop
# Write a loop (any type) to print each item from the list along with a custom message: "I like <item>".
# hobbies = ["reading", "gaming", "coding"]
