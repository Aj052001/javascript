# What will be the output of the following code?



# x = 10
# y = 20
# print(x == y)
# Evaluate the expression:



# x = 15
# print(x > 10 and x < 20)
# Identify the correct operator to use for "less than or equal to."

# What is the result of:



# a = 5
# b = 5
# print(a != b)
# Write a  condition to check if a variable z is both greater than 10 and less than or equal to 50.

# Logical Operators
# What will this expression evaluate to?



# x = 3
# print(x < 5 or x > 10)
# Predict the output of the following code:



# x = 7
# y = 12
# print(not(x > y or y < 15))


# Which logical operator would you use to ensure two conditions are both true?  

# What does the not operator do when applied to a boolean expression?

# Simplify this statement using logical operators:
# x = 8
# if (x > 10 and x < 20):
#     print("Valid")



# Identity Operators
# Determine the output:



# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [1, 2, 3]
# print(a is b)


# What will x is not y return if x and y refer to different objects with the same value?
# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [1, 2, 3]

# print(a is  b )

# Is it possible for x == y to return True but x is y to return False? Explain with an example.
# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = [1, 2, 3]
# print(a  ==  b )
# print(a is  b )

# Write a condition to check if two variables a and b point to the same object in memory.

# a = [1, 2, 3]
# b = a

# Membership Operators   in ,not in 
# Predict the output:

text = "Hello, World!"
print("Hello" in text)
